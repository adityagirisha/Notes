- What Methods?
- How Thorough?

## Defining the Scope

- What portion of the network
  - Test cloud?
  - Test Wireless Sys?
  - Test Cloud tools?

Before Testing Infra, Ensure all the system, network and business architecture is mapped out to draw distinctions

## Adversary Emulation

- Emulating a threat actor
- copy domain specific APTs by learing their tactics,techniques and procedures (TTPs)

## Levels of threat actors

|Threat Level|Info|
|-|-|
|Script Kiddie|Uses Available tools|
|Insider Threat|rogue employee leveraging their clearance level|
|Competitors|rogue companies trying to do cyber espionage|
|Organized Crime|Scammers trying to make profit|
|Hacktivists|Protesting through hacks|
|APT|Nation sponsored hacker groups|

threat modeling can also occur via resource tiers such as money, time and other resources

|Tier|Info|
|-|-|
|T1|No Money, Low resources|
|T2|Individual with Little Money, Little Resources|
|T3|org level money|
|T4|high tech, well funded|
|T5|APT|
|T6|Military Intelligence|

## Target List

- First Party vs Third Party Target Ownership
- Physical vs Online threat vectors

- Associated Assets
  - Other Offices
  - Employee Devices
  - Vendor Companies
  - Employees (Social Engineering to be included?)
  
- Network targets to include?
  - Wireless Networks
  - Sections of network to include?
  - IPs/ domains, sub domains, DNS
  - routers, switches, DMZ

## Identify Restrictions

- Timeline and Scheduling - ensure customer understands how long it will take and what the testing schedule can affect
- Downtime possibility
- Impact and Risk Tolerance
- Legal Restrictions of region/sector

## Rules of Engagement

- Timeline - series of events, schedules and working hours
- Locations - onsite vs remote
- Time Restrictions - Prod Cycle, Maintenance, Busy Period
- Transparency - Point and  channels of customer contact and Trusted Agent that can vouch for ethical testing
- Boundaries - what not to touch

## Assessment Types

> Goal Based
        - Attempt to achieve a specific goal
        - which server
        - which network



> Objective Based 
        - what resource
        - what kind of attack
        - what to achieve

> Compliance Based 
        - what compliance to meet
        - Internal vs External compliance standard
        - GDPR/HIPPA/SOX/GLBA
